## Requirements 

At a minimum, you must create:

- An endpoint to subscribe a customer to a tea subscription
- An endpoint to cancel a customer’s tea subscription
- An endpoint to see all of a customer’s subsciptions (active and cancelled)

- Beyond the base requirements, include any additional endpoints you’d like, but be mindful of your time. You don’t need to go overboard, consider what might be necessary to achieve MVP so that this API is easy to understand and consume by a Frontend Developer.
